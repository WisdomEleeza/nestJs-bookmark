Modules:

- Modules are used to encapsulate and organize different parts of your application.
- They define the scope of the application and group related components like controllers, services, and providers together.
- Modules are where you import and configure dependencies, including other modules and any global settings.
- You can think of modules as the building blocks of your NestJS application.
Controllers:

- Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and define the routes for your application.
- They are responsible for processing requests, invoking the appropriate services to perform business logic, and returning responses.
- Controllers contain methods (actions) that are annotated with decorators like @Get, @Post, @Put, etc., to define the route handlers.
Services:

- Services contain the business logic of your application.
- They encapsulate the functionality that is not directly related to processing HTTP requests but is necessary to implement the application's features.
- Services are often used to interact with databases, perform data manipulation, and implement various application-specific logic.
- Controllers delegate the handling of business logic to services.
- Here's a more detailed breakdown of the responsibilities of each component:

Modules:

- Define the boundaries of your application.
- Import and configure dependencies, including other modules.
- Declare providers (services) that can be injected into controllers.
- Can be organized by features, allowing you to create reusable and maintainable code.
- Controllers:

- Define the routes and route handlers for HTTP requests.
- Receive incoming requests, validate input data, and invoke services to perform actions.
- Use decorators like @Get, @Post, etc., to specify the route and HTTP method for each action.
- Optionally handle request and response objects for more fine-grained control.
Services:

- Contain the application's business logic and core functionality.
- Encapsulate data manipulation, interactions with databases, external APIs, and any other non-HTTP-related operations.
- Can be injected into controllers to provide separation of concerns and maintainability.
- Promote reusability and testability since they can be easily mocked during testing.
In summary, NestJS follows the principle of separation of concerns, where modules organize your application, 
controllers handle HTTP requests, and services encapsulate business logic. This separation makes your code more maintainable, testable, and scalable.
